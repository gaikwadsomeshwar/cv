        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I was introduced to the world of programming when I was in my 6th Grade. We were told to write a C++ code to calculate Prime Numbers and check for Palindrome Numbers during that time. I was completely mesmerized by the working of the code, such systematic execution of task at high-rate. Since, then I decide to become a Computer Programmer.</p>

        <img class="database-img" src="images/mysql.png" alt="MySQL Image">
        <h3>Database Management</h3>
        <p>I had my first encounter with databases in my First Year of Engineering, when we were told to store records in a File System. At that time I was not mature enough to understand what a database actually means. I was later introduced to MySQl in my Third Year and at this point of time after dealing with various data structures and alogorithms I was completely attracted towards developing efficient databases for my projects.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain</h3>
        <p>I was introduced to Blockchain in my Second Year of Engineering. I was completely taken in by the different consensus alogorithms and by the use cases. Currently, I am working on a Project to <em>Manage E-Health Records using Blockchain.</em></p>
